# Specific paths based on your project structure
# These ensure any 'integrationService/' or 'product/djangoProject/' specific
# .gitignore rules that might apply to the root are covered.
# For example, if there were .env files directly inside these subdirectories
# that weren't already caught by the general patterns.

# If any sub-service has a 'db.sqlite3' directly in its root (e.g., cart/db.sqlite3)
# the general rule 'db.sqlite3' will catch it.
